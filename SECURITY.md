## Supported Versions

Cosmic Comics works on a rolling-base. That mean, they're no "stable" version and the supported version is always the latest commit on the "master" branch.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |
