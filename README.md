4. When prompted for the beta version, say 'yes' until the release of the 2.0.0.<br>

Creating a shortcut is very recommended.

### Cloning
*UNLIMITED POWER!!*

Installing difficulty : ðŸ˜­

Wow, you must be a developer...<br/>
#### pre-requisite
- Git
- Node.js
- NPM (included in Node.js for Windows)
- Python (for compiling some Node.js modules)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (for compiling some Node.js modules) (for windows)
- make (for linux)
- Build-essential (for ubuntu)

Assuming you have all the prerequisite installed, clone the repository in a new directory with Git :<br/>
`git clone https://github.com/Nytuo/Cosmic-Comics.git`

Then install the dependencies with 
`npm install --production`.<br/>
Then run the app with `node server.js`.<br/>
You will have access to all the features of the app, directly in your browser.


### Portable Edition
#### Electron
The executable installer cannot be used for a portable version.<br>
The ".zip" file provides a portable support.<br/>
Create a directory and another one in it and extract the ".zip" file in the last directory.<br/>
Go to `CosmicComics/resources/app/` and create a file called `portable.txt` with `electron` written inside.<br/>
The 'Data' folder will be created in the first directory you created.<br/>

### Script
The script asks you if you want to install in a portable way on Windows.<br/>
Linux's users cannot because the script requires to install apps in the system.
### Cloning
You cannot use this installation method for a portable version.
## Update

If an update is available, the application will download it and install it when you quit.

The update proceed when the script is started.

## How to start Development?
Run the following on a command prompt (shell)
Note: Here I use `Yarn` but you can also use  `NPM`
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nytuo/CosmicComics.git
cd CosmicComics
yarn install
yarn upgrade
yarn start
```

## Known Issues
Very much at this time...

## Mobile Version ?
Cosmic Comics now runs on a server, that means you can actually connect to any servers within your favorite web browser. No matter if you are on mobile, desktop or console.
That said, an android and android TV application is in plan to offer a better experience.

However, you will NEED A RUNNING SERVER on a supported platform (Linux, Windows or macos) in order to access it.
The application WILL NOT work standalone. The app use many libraries that not work on android like unrar and this will take me too much time to create a dedicated mobile application. Some for a standalone use I recommand you using TAKIOMI OR CDisplayEX android.


## Got an idea of something which could be added or enhanced ?
