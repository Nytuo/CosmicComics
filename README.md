## Known Issues and future changes
See the <a href="https://github.com/users/Nytuo/projects/2">project</a> tab on Github

## Mobile Version ?
Cosmic Comics now runs on a server, that means you can actually connect to any servers within your favorite web browser. No matter if you are on mobile, desktop or console.
That said, an android and android TV application is in plan to offer a better experience.

However, you will NEED A RUNNING SERVER on a supported platform (Linux, Windows or macos) in order to access it.
The application WILL NOT work standalone. The app use many libraries that not work on android like unrar and this will take me too much time to create a dedicated mobile application. For a standalone use I recommand you using TAKIOMI OR CDisplayEX android.
